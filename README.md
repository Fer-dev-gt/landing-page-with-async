# landing-page-with-async
This is a customized landing page using the knowledge I acquired from the platzi course about callback, promises and async/await.
The theme of the site is dedicated to an friendly and comfy restaurant where you can relax and eat some of your favorites meals with a pixel aesthetic.
Please enjoy and any feedback is super welcome! ðŸ‘¾
